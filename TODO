# Pre

Redo processing/ROI using Makefile.  Get all possible ROIs this time.

# Phase 1.
FH

1. Space PCA of EVA/FIR.
2. Time PCA of trials from each voxel.

Ploran

3. Space PCA of EVA.

Compare between 1 and 2
Compare between 1 and 3

# Meanwhile

- Write python interface for Ploran 2007
- Reprocess the rest of the data
- Run simulations of decision signal mixtures w/ PCA, ICA, and so on

# Phase 2

1. Space PCA of EVA/FIR for the rest of the data.

# Phase 3.

1. Classify select components
2. Non-linear reductions (select? repeat all?).
